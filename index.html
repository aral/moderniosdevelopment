			<h2>Course summary</h2>
			<!-- <img style="width:100%;" src="/images/blueprints.jpg" alt="iPhone and iPad blueprints"> -->
			<p><strong>In unique, three‐day intensive workshop written and presented by experience designer and developer Aral Balkan will empower you with solid foundations in designing and developing native iPhone and iPad apps using modern practices in Objective-C and Cocoa Touch.</strong>

			<p>The course is constantly updated and covers the latest tools, technologies, and devices, including Xcode 4.5, Objective-C 2.0, iOS6, and the new iPhone 5.</p>

			<p>This is the right class for you if you are a developer with real‐world experience in at least one object‐oriented programming language (scripting languages like JavaScript, ActionScript, Python, and Ruby count).</p>

			<p>Experience with Objective‐C or Cocoa Touch is not necessary.</p>

			<p>You will spend three days hands‐on coding with Aral as you learn how to build native apps that conform to Apple’s coding practices and human interface guidelines.</p>

			<p>This is also the right course for you if you have been dabbling in iOS development without entirely understanding everything you’re doing. The course will cover all of the core concepts in detail to ensure that there are no gaps left in your knowledge. You will learn why we do things in certain ways, instead of relying on copy and paste snippets. Once we’re done, nothing about Objective‐C or Cocoa Touch will seem mysterious or magical. You will be writing&#8202;—&#8202;and understanding the reason for&#8202;—&#8202;every line of code in your apps . Even past students who had already worked professionally on iOS apps and who had published apps on the App Store reported benefiting greatly from the solid foundations they gained from the course.</p>

			<p>The aim of the workshop is not to razzle dazzle you by showing you all of the latest snazzy APIs. Instead, you will be empowered with solid foundations in Objective‐C and Cocoa Touch, an understanding of the culture and conventions of the iOS platform, and the confidence to navigate the system frameworks. Subsequently, once you’ve completed the course, you will be well‐equipped to learn and use any of the thousands of iOS APIs that you may encounter when developing your own projects.</p>
			<p class="highlight">Places are limited to just 12 students to ensure you get personal attention.</p>

			<h2>Highlights</h2>
			<p>The following topics, among others, will be covered in this intensive, hands‐on three‐day workshop:</p>

				<li>Get a solid foundation in Objective-C and and Cocoa Touch</li>
				<li>Learn about classes, protocols, categories, methods, and properties</li>
				<li>Learn important patterns like Model View Controller, Observer, Mixin, etc., and how they are implemented and used in Cocoa Touch with data sources, target/action pairs, delegates, notifications, and more.</li>
				<li>Learn modern practices, including using the latest collection literals (literals for arrays, dictionaries, etc.) and modern property syntax (with full understanding of what properties are shorthand for)</li>
				<li>Working with Automatical Reference Counting (ARC)</li>
				<li>Background on older methods of working (manual memory management, etc.) so you can work with legacy code.</li>
				<li>Using class extensions to implement ‘private’ methods and properties</li>
				<li>Using blocks for asynchronous tasks.</li>
				<li>Asynchronous networking, consuming APIs, and using JSON</li>
				<li>Creating hybrid apps that use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via the UIWebView </li>

			<h2>Testimonials</h2>
			<p>Here’s what past students have to say about Aral’s iOS workshops.</p>

			<blockquote>I had an immensely useful couple of days, and now feel a lot more up to speed than I could have hoped for compared with purely using a book or web-based reference guides.<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;John‐Paul Jones</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Just to let you know that I’ve had a free app published on the iTunes store and I’m also going to a meeting next week to discuss a commercial app development project. I spot that you are running another class this month, may I wish you great success. I certainly found our three days incredibly useful, both from a technical and a wider-than-technical perspective for iPhone development.<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Paul Ford-Hutchinson</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Thank you, Aral, for teaching me a solid iphone development foundation and making me feel more confident to start working on other projects!<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Thomas Joos</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>I just spent 3 days with Aral learning iPhone and Objective‐C development. I had a blast! I’m ready to kick some #app now :)<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Louis de Decker</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Successfully finished a 3‐day iPhone development workshop by Aral Balkan and man, it was AWE-SOME!<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Mario Van den Eynde</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Thank you, Aral, for an excellent 3 days. Feel more excited about development work than I have in years, if ever!<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Andy Law</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Can’t recommend it highly enough&#8202;—&#8202;excellent.<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Robert Turrall</blockquote>
