			<h2>Course summary</h2>
			<!-- <img style="width:100%;" src="/images/blueprints.jpg" alt="iPhone and iPad blueprints"> -->
			<p><strong>This three‐day intensive workshop written and presented by experience designer and developer Aral Balkan will teach you solid foundations in designing and developing native iPhone and iPad apps using modern practices in Objective-C and Cocoa Touch.</strong>

			<p>The course covers the latest tools, technologies, and devices, including Xcode 4.5, Objective-C 2.0, iOS6, and the new iPhone 5.</p>
			<p>You will spend three days hands‐on coding with Aral as you learn how to build native apps that conform to Apple’s coding practices and human interface guidelines.</p>
			<p>The aim of the class is not to razzle dazzle you by showing you all of the latest snazzy APIs. Instead, you will be empowered with a solid foundation in Objective‐C and Cocoa Touch so that you understand the culture and conventions of the iOS platform and can subsequently learn to use any of the thousands of iOS APIs you may encounter in your own projects.</p>
			<p class="highlight">Places are limited to just 12 students to ensure you get personal attention.</p>

			<h2>Highlights</h2>
			<p>The following topics, and more, will be covered in this intensive, three‐day workshop:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Learn about design considerations for the entire iOS platform, including hardware differences between devices (including the new iPhone 5 and new iPad) and user experience considerations when designing your apps.</li>
				<li>Write professional code that is consistent with the conventions of Cocoa Touch and the system frameworks using Xcode 4.5 and iOS6.</li>
				<li>Get a solid foundation in Objective-C and and Cocoa Touch</li>
				<li>Learn about classes, protocols, categories, methods, and properties</li>
				<li>Learn important patterns like Model View Controller, Observer, Mixin, etc., and how they are implemented and used in Cocoa Touch with data sources, target/action pairs, delegates, notifications, and more.</li>
				<li>Learn modern practices, including using the latest collection literals (literals for arrays, dictionaries, etc.) and modern property syntax (with full understanding of what properties are shorthand for)</li>
				<li>Working with Automatical Reference Counting (ARC)</li>
				<li>Background on older methods of working (manual memory management, etc.) so you can work with legacy code.</li>
				<li>Using class extensions to implement ‘private’ methods and properties</li>
				<li>Using blocks for asynchronous tasks.</li>
				<li>Asynchronous networking, consuming APIs, and using JSON</li>
				<li>Creating hybrid apps that use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via the UIWebView </li>
				<li>Optimising your workflow for high resolution, including the 4" display of the new iPhone 5</li>
				<li>Social integration with Twitter and Facebook via the Social Framework</li>
				<li>Discussion of important iOS6‐specific features like Collection Views, UI State Preservation, Auto Layout, and Data Privacy.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Testimonials</h2>
			<p>Here’s what past students have to say about Aral’s iOS workshops.</p>

			<blockquote>I had an immensely useful couple of days, and now feel a lot more up to speed than I could have hoped for compared with purely using a book or web-based reference guides.<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;John‐Paul Jones</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Just to let you know that I’ve had a free app published on the iTunes store and I’m also going to a meeting next week to discuss a commercial app development project. I spot that you are running another class this month, may I wish you great success. I certainly found our three days incredibly useful, both from a technical and a wider-than-technical perspective for iPhone development.<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Paul Ford-Hutchinson</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Thank you, Aral, for teaching me a solid iphone development foundation and making me feel more confident to start working on other projects!<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Thomas Joos</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>I just spent 3 days with Aral learning iPhone and Objective‐C development. I had a blast! I’m ready to kick some #app now :)<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Louis de Decker</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Successfully finished a 3‐day iPhone development workshop by Aral Balkan and man, it was AWE-SOME!<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Mario Van den Eynde</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Thank you, Aral, for an excellent 3 days. Feel more excited about development work than I have in years, if ever!<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Andy Law</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote>Can’t recommend it highly enough&#8202;—&#8202;excellent.<span class="quote-byline">&#8202;—&#8202;Robert Turrall</blockquote>
